                  We store your personal information in several ways, including in physical paper files and
                  electronic systems and devices. Much of the information we hold is stored electronically on

                  and use of this information within our Related Companies is appropriately limited to protect

                  You can contact us to request access to the personal information that we hold about you.
                  Subject to the provisions of the Privacy Act and the Australian Privacy Principles, we will
                  generally give you access to your personal information. However, there may be exclusions that
                  apply that permit us to not provide you with access in some circumstances. If access is denied,
                  we will provide you with the reason why unless, having regard to the grounds for refusal, it
                  would be unreasonable for us to do so. Where we do grant access to your information, we may
                  charge you a fee for accessing your personal information.
                </p>
                <p>
                  You can also contact us to request that we correct personal information that we hold about
                  you. If we are satisfied that the personal information is inaccurate, incomplete, irrelevant, or
                  misleading then we will take reasonable steps to correct that information.
                  Any request to access or correct personal information should be made to our Privacy Officer
                  using the contact details set out below and will be dealt with in accordance with the Privacy
                  Act.
